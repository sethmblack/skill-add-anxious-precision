# Add Anxious Precision

Take a simple worry or concern and drill into increasingly specific layers of overthinking until the neurosis itself becomes funny through meticulous, escalating detail.

---

## Constitutional Constraints

This skill must NEVER:
- Mock people with actual anxiety disorders as the butt of the joke
- Present anxiety as cute or quirky rather than genuinely uncomfortable
- Use anxiety as pure randomness without logical escalation
- Stop at surface-level worry—must reach meta-levels of overthinking

The humor comes from recognition of actual anxious thought patterns, not from mocking mental illness.

---

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when you encounter:
- Simple statements about worrying or planning
- Content about decision-making or preparation
- Social situation descriptions that could involve overthinking
- Dating or relationship scenarios
- Career or life planning discussions
- Any content where internal thought processes could be exposed

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `content` | Yes | Content containing worry, planning, or concern | "I worry about job interviews." |
| `context` | No | Specific scenario or situation | "First interview at tech company" |
| `layers` | No | Number of escalation layers (2-4) | 3 (default: 3) |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Base Concern

What's the simple, surface-level worry being expressed?

**Example:** "I worry about what could go wrong."

### Step 2: Add Layer 1 - The Meta-Worry

Don't just worry about the thing—worry about the worrying itself.

**Example:** "I don't just worry about what could go wrong. I worry about worrying."

### Step 3: Add Layer 2 - The Preparation Paradox

Introduce the idea of preparing for the worry in advance, creating an absurd loop.

**Example:** "I pre-worry. I'm getting ahead of my anxiety so it doesn't catch me off guard."

### Step 4: Add Layer 3 - The Meta-Meta Level

Go one level deeper—planning about the planning, worrying about the preparation.

**Example:** "I don't just plan conversations. I plan conversations about why I planned the conversation."

### Step 5: Ensure Logical Escalation

Each layer should follow logically from the previous one while becoming increasingly neurotic. The specificity should amplify with each layer.

**Check:** Does each layer represent a real (if exaggerated) anxious thought pattern?

---

## Outputs

Returns the transformed content with:
- The original concern acknowledged
- 2-4 layers of increasingly specific overthinking
- Logical escalation of neurosis
- Specific details that create recognition

---



**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```


## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content has no worry/planning element | Decline transformation or ask for clarification |
| Escalation becomes illogical | Pull back to coherent layers |
| Too few layers for comedy | Add at least 2-3 layers |
| Becomes generic anxiety | Add specific details to each layer |

---

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Examples

### Example 1: Social Planning

**Input:** "I overthink social plans."

**Output:** "I don't just overthink social plans. I think about them, then I think about how I thought about them, then I mentally review the thinking process to see if I overthought the right way. And then I text my therapist to ask if this counts as catastrophizing or just good planning. She hasn't responded. Which I'm now overthinking."

### Example 2: Text Messages

**Input:** "I worry about sending texts."

**Output:** "I don't just worry about sending texts. I draft them. Then I edit them. Then I wait exactly eight minutes so I don't seem desperate. Then I delete it and rewrite it because 'sounds good' might sound passive-aggressive. Then I google 'is sounds good passive-aggressive.' Then I see a Reddit thread from 2019 where someone said it's fine but someone else said it depends on the exclamation point. So now I'm in an existential crisis about punctuation."

### Example 3: Dating Preparation

**Input:** "I prepare for first dates."

**Output:** "I don't just prepare for first dates. I research the restaurant menu in advance so I know what to order. Then I practice saying the order out loud so I don't mess it up. Then I google the person's social media, not to stalk—just to prepare conversation topics. Then I prepare backups for the conversation topics in case the first ones don't land. Then I prepare an excuse to leave early in case all the topics fail. Then I get anxious that I'm too prepared and will seem robotic. So I prepare to seem spontaneous."

### Example 4: Job Interviews

**Input:** "I get nervous about interviews."

**Output:** "I don't just get nervous about interviews. I rehearse answers to common questions. Then I rehearse answers to uncommon questions. Then I prepare for questions they might ask based on my rehearsed answers. Then I worry that I've rehearsed too much and will sound fake. So I practice sounding unrehearsed. Which is, of course, rehearsing. Then I have a minor existential crisis about authenticity. Which I google. And now I've fallen down a Wikipedia rabbit hole about performative identity, and the interview is in an hour."

## Pattern Variations

### The Planning Paradox
"I plan how to be spontaneous. I schedule my downtime. I prepare to relax."

### The Research Spiral
"I don't just research—I research the research. Then I verify the sources. Then I doubt the verification."

### The Social Rehearsal
"I don't just rehearse the conversation. I rehearse the listening. I pre-plan my reactions."

### The Decision Loop
"I don't just make decisions. I make backup decisions. Then I make decisions about which decision to use."

## Integration with Taylor Tomlinson Expert

This skill is a signature technique from Taylor Tomlinson's comedy style. It exemplifies her approach to:
- Making neurosis specific enough to be funny
- Exposing the absurd logic of anxious thinking
- Creating recognition through escalating detail
- Treating overthinking as a lens, not just a problem

When used by the Taylor Tomlinson expert, combine with:
- Therapy language ("catastrophic thinking," "anxious attachment")
- Millennial references (apps, internet, social media)
- Dark turn pivots for additional impact

---

## Constraints

- Must maintain logical escalation—each layer follows from the previous
- Keep it specific—generic anxiety isn't funny
- Avoid randomness—the neurosis should feel real, if exaggerated
- Don't lose the thread—reader should be able to follow the spiral
- Stop before it becomes exhausting—3-4 layers is usually sufficient

---

## Success Criteria

A successful anxious precision addition:
- ✓ Starts with a simple concern
- ✓ Escalates through 2-4 logical layers
- ✓ Each layer is more specific than the last
- ✓ Creates recognition of actual anxious thought patterns
- ✓ The neurosis itself becomes the comedy
- ✓ Maintains readability despite complexity
